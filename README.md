# Coder Doctor üßë‚Äç‚öïÔ∏è

Coder Doctor is a command-line diagnostic tool for checking that a
given platform can run the Coder control plane and workspaces.

## Supported Platforms

Currently, the following platforms are supported, with the following
preflight checks:

### Kubernetes

- Kubernetes Version: checks that the selected Coder version is
  compatible with the Kubernetes control plane.
- Helm Version: checks the locally-installed Helm version for
  compatibility with the requested version of Coder.
- Kubernetes RBAC: checks that the service account has the required
  permissions to run Coder.
- Kubernetes Resources: checks that the cluster has the required
  resource types available to run Coder.

## Installation

You can manually download the latest [release](https://github.com/cdr/coder-doctor/releases):

1. Click a release and download the tar file for your operating system
   (ex: coder-doctor-linux-amd64.tar.gz)
1. (Optional, recommended) Download the `checksums.txt` for the desired
   release and verify the `sha256` checksum of the file you downloaded.
1. Extract the `coder-doctor` binary.
1. Move the `coder-doctor` binary to somewhere in your `$PATH` (e.g., `mv coder-doctor /usr/local/bin/coder-doctor` for macOS/Linux).
2. (macOS Users) You may need to [grant `coder-doctor` additional permissions](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202491) before running.

Alternatively, use the below command, replacing `$VERSION`, `$OSTYPE`
(one of `darwin`, `linux`, `windows`) and `$ARCH` (one of `amd64`, `arm64`)
as required:

```shell-session
$ curl -fSsL "https://github.com/cdr/coder-doctor/releases/latest/download/coder-doctor_${VERSION}_${OSTYPE}_${ARCH}.tar.gz" | tar -xzvf -
README.md
coder-doctor
```

## Usage

To check if your Kubernetes cluster is ready to install Coder, run:

```console
coder-doctor check kubernetes
```

For more information, you can run:

```console
coder-doctor -h
```

## Development

To run from source, clone the repository and run:

```bash
go run . help
```

The `Makefile` also includes various helpful targets to run
linters and tests, but standard Go tools (e.g. `go test`)
should work as well.

## Feedback

**Note:** This tool is in `beta` state and Coder offers no compatibility
guarantees, either for the tool itself or any public Go APIs. Most code
is kept in the `internal` package to make this clear, and will be promoted
to an externally-importable package once things stabilize.
